Alex was really tired yesterday but he decided to go out with his friends and
have fun instead of studying. He had a test the next day and was tired of 
getting bad grades even after he studied for a long time. So, instead of 
continuing to study, he decided to spend some time having fun and actually 
relaxing. 

For a while, they just roamed about the streets of Cityville, looking for something
interesting to do with their new-found free time. As they approach a local arcade,
they hear a quiet voice coming from an alleyway to the right, leading behind the building.
"Hey, guys. Shouldn't you kids be studying for your exams?", asks a man crouching behind
a dumpster, wearing a trench coat and Adam-Jensen-esque shades. "Here's a little free
sample for ya. You know where to find me if you want more." He gives a wink and vanishes
into the shadows of the alleyway, leaving behind a colourful metal canister. Alex
cautiously approaches it and grabs it. "INTELLICO(tm) SPRAY-ON KNOWLEDGE", it reads.
